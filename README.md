# üöÄ Download Better GPU

> **Warning: This repository contains highly classified quantum GPU transmission technology. Please handle with care.**

## What is this madness?

Tired of paying $1,500+ for a graphics card that becomes obsolete the moment you buy it? Fed up with waiting 6 months for restocks? Well, wait no more!

**Download Better GPU** is the revolutionary solution that lets you download graphics cards directly to your computer through the power of ‚ú®*science*‚ú®.

Inspired by the legendary [downloadmoreram.com](https://downloadmoreram.com/), this is what happens when a developer gets frustrated with GPU prices and has 30 minutes to spare.

## üéÆ Features

- **Quantum GPU Transmission**: Download RTX 5090s with 32GB GDDR7 straight through your internet connection
- **Zero Installation**: No screwdrivers required - GPUs materialize in your PCIe 5.0 slot automatically
- **100% Free**: Why pay $2000+ when you can download for free?
- **Realistic Progress Bars**: Complete with authentic technical jargon like "Transmitting CUDA/Stream processors..."
- **Multiple GPU Options**: From budget Intel ARC B580 to ultimate RTX 5090
- **Mobile Responsive**: Download GPUs on the go!

## üõ† Tech Stack

This cutting-edge application is built with:

- **HTML5**: For structure (obviously)
- **CSS3**: With gradients so beautiful they'll make your RTX 5090 weep
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks needed when you have pure quantum physics
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting for free GPU downloads (it's free all the way down)

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone this repository (downloading the repo is free, unlike actual GPUs)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yaq1n0/downloadbettergpu.git
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Select your desired GPU
4. Click download and watch the magic happen
5. ~~Restart your computer~~ (this part actually doesn't work, sorry)

## üìä Download Statistics

- **Total GPUs Downloaded**: ‚àû (limited only by your imagination)
- **Success Rate**: 100%\*
- **Customer Satisfaction**: 420/69
- **Actual Hardware Materialized**: 0 (but hey, the animation is smooth!)

\* _Success measured in entertainment value, not actual hardware acquisition_

## üéØ FAQ

**Q: Does this actually download a GPU to my computer?**  
A: Of course not! This is a joke website. If you could actually download hardware, Intel wouldn't have needed to make the ARC B580 so affordable.

**Q: Why did you make this?**  
A: I was tired of seeing "$1,999 - Out of Stock" on RTX 5090 listings everywhere and decided channeling my frustration into code was healthier than crying.

**Q: Can you make one for CPUs?**  
A: Already working on "Download Better CPU" - coming to a GitHub near you!

**Q: Is the source code available?**  
A: You're literally looking at it right now.

## üôè Acknowledgments

- **[downloadmoreram.com](https://downloadmoreram.com/)** - The OG that inspired this madness
- **NVIDIA & AMD & Intel** - For making GPUs so expensive that downloading them seems reasonable
- **Crypto miners** - For making us all collectively lose our minds (again)
- **AI Datacenters** - For buying up all of TSMC's wafer capacity
- **The laws of physics** - Sorry for temporarily ignoring you

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This is a parody website. You cannot actually download physical hardware components over the internet. If this worked, we'd all be rich and GPU shortages would be a thing of the past.

Please buy graphics cards from legitimate retailers (when they're actually in stock at reasonable prices, which is... still never).
